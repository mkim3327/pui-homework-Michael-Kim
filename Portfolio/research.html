                <a>My research focuses on Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases (LPMOs), particularly 
                    their role in oxidase reactions and potential involvement in C-H hydroxylation 
                    through a Fenton-like mechanism. Using synthetic copper complexes, I investigated 
                    the interaction between copper and oxygen, suggesting LPMOs' ability to generate 
                    hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for oxidase reactivity. Currently, I'm advancing this work 
                    by modifying ligand scaffolds to better understand copper/O2 species. This research 
                    contributes to our understanding of enzymatic catalysis and holds promise for 
                    developing innovative catalysts for industrial and environmental applications.</a>

                <a>This research focused on developing functionalized graphenic materials (FGMs) for 
                    bone regeneration. Graphite was converted into graphene oxide and modified with 
                    functional groups to tailor its properties. Characterization confirmed FGMs' 
                    mechanical similarity to bone. In vitro tests with mammalian cells showed FGMs' 
                    ability to support cell growth and osteogenic differentiation. Degradation studies 
                    demonstrated biocompatibility. These findings highlight FGMs' potential as 
                    biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, offering promising prospects for 
                    regenerative medicine.</a>

                <a>As a pivotal member of a major project, I focus on creating a clinical 
                    decision-support (CDS) tool tailored for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) care. 
                    My tasks include reviewing documents, refining interview protocols, and conducting 
                    clinician interviews to understand PAH's clinical nuances. This hands-on approach 
                    provides crucial insights for aligning the CDS tool with real-world practice. 
                    Additionally, I collaborate with the team to analyze interview data, guiding the 
                    iterative design process. This multifaceted involvement not only deepens my 
                    understanding of PAH but also empowers me to contribute to innovative solutions that 
                    could improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes in PAH management.</a>
